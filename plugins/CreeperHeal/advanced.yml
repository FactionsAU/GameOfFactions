# command-alias: If the /ch command conflicts with another plugin, you can
# change it here.
#
# lightweight-mode: Skip some tests. The plugin is slightly faster, but the
# replacement quality is somehow degraded, especially concerning vines, leaves
# and falling blocks. default false.
#
# wait-before-burn-again: Delay (in s) for which a burnt block is immune to fire after
# replacement. default 240.
#
# prevent-block-fall: If true, blocks that should fall because their support
# was blown up will not fall.
#
# overwrite-blocks: If true, the blocks placed in an explosion hole will be
# dropped when the explosion is replaced.
#
# drop-destroyed-blocks: if enabled, destroyed blocks will be dropped on the
# ground, with the percent chance defined. default true, 100
#
# teleport-when-buried: If enabled, entities suffocating because of block
# replacement will be teleported to the surface, or the nearest empty spot.
#
# distance-near: Distance, in blocks, that is considered near when replacing
# nearby explosions. default 20
#
# prevent-chain-reaction: If enabled, TNT blocks in an explosion will not
# explode. Default false.
#
# obsidian: Gives the possibility to explode obsidian blocks. If explode is set
# to true, for every explosion, every obsidian block in the radius will have
# the defined chance of exploding. default false, 5, 20
#
# replace-silverfish-blocks: If enabled, blocks destroyed by spawning silverfish 
# will be repaired a while later.
#
# join-nearby-explosions: If enabled, nearby explosions will be joined in one big
# explosion, allowing for nicer repairs (although slower, because the repairs are
# sequential and not parallel). Requires performance.keep-leaves-vines.
#
# log-warnings: When a warning is issued for griefing, log that message to the
# log file. default true.
#
# verbose-level: Verbosity level of the messages. 1 for standard messages, 0
# for critical messages only. default 1
#
# debug-messages: Display debug messages. Not recommended.
